                    Although we have advanced considerably, there is still a lot more to reach in the terms of equality of all races.
                     last years events in the United States can never be forgotten or forgiven for that matter.
                      The straight forward murder of George Floyd serves enough testimony for this.
                       But as if this wasn’t enough for some, just earlier this week, another death of a black motorist was recorded who was killed, 
                       again by a cop, for having an expired car registration. This definitely made most of us furious but still we can’t stop this,
                        or it seems like we can’t.

                    There is so much we can do but obviously its easier said than done. 
                    We know when something is not right but we either don't have the nerve to speak up or(mostly) don't find any need to.
                     And i don't blame you for that. Not exactly.
                     On the other hand, the ones that do find the nerve and determination to fight against the injustice, unhestitantly supported and still support the black lives matter movement. And I am proudly among them.
