                  Gender discrimination. it seems like a topic already been discussed and solved for. But llets just ask our selves, it is really over? Are we really equal to each other in terms of gender? the answer is probably no.
                  <br>
                  lets see, how many times have you yourself experienced this premonition that the colour blue is associated with girls and pink with boys? Did you find something wrong? that is the differenciation that has been inbulit in our systems regarding just some stupid colour.

If you dont, that's wonderful too. Gender equalit is your(men's) issue too. Both MEN and WOMEN should feel free to be strong..."

                    this is where feminism comes. it is not about man-hating at all. It is simply there to make people realise that women arent any less stronger than men.

                    although we are working forward to achieve equality by giving equal pay, equal opportunities and so on, there is still some amount of discrimination that creeps in the society and thus differenciates males from females.
